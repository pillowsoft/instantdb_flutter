Excellent progress! 🎉 The presence system is now working
  correctly:

  ✅ Major Success:

  - No more 500 errors! The set-presence operation works
  - Server accepts messages and responds with set-presence-ok
  - Both instances receive refresh-presence messages with
  reaction data
  - Instance 2 is getting the presence data from Instance 1

  🔍 Analysis of the logs:

  Instance 1 (sender):
  - Sends reactions with ❤️ and 😄 emojis
  - Gets set-presence-ok confirmations from server
  - Receives refresh-presence with updated data

  Instance 2 (receiver):
  - Receives refresh-presence messages containing the
  reaction data:
  "data":{"emoji":"❤️","x":637.2109375,"y":700.8359375,"userI
  d":"ce5b06c4-cb60-4098-958a-67b0bdaf51be"}
  - The data is being processed by PresenceManager

  🎯 The Missing Piece:

  The issue is that Instance 2 isn't showing the reactions in
   the UI. The data is arriving correctly, but our
  handleRefreshPresenceMessage method isn't converting the
  presence data back into visible reactions.

  Looking at the refresh-presence data structure:
  {
    "68ad0da7-4fbf-475c-b18a-336fd25cc546": {
      "peer-id": "68ad0da7-4fbf-475c-b18a-336fd25cc546",
      "user": null,
      "data": {
        "emoji": "😄",
        "x": 426.71875,
        "y": 582.9609375,
        "userId": "ce5b06c4-cb60-4098-958a-67b0bdaf51be"
      }
    }
  }

  The issue is in our handleRefreshPresenceMessage method -
  it's treating this as general presence data instead of
  recognizing it as reaction data that should create visible
  reaction animations.

  We need to:
  1. Detect when the presence data contains reaction
  information
  2. Convert it to ReactionData objects
  3. Add them to _roomReactions and notify the reaction
  signal

  The reactions are getting to Instance 2, we just need to
  display them! 🚀
