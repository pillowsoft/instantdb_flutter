# Testing Cloud Synchronization

## What Was Fixed
The cloud reactivity issue has been resolved. The problem was that queries weren't being sent to InstantDB server, so it didn't know to send updates when other clients made changes.

## How to Test

### 1. Start Fresh
- Stop any running instances
- Clear your browser cache if testing on web
- Make sure you have your `.env` file with `INSTANTDB_API_ID`

### 2. Run Two Instances
```bash
# Terminal 1
flutter run -d chrome

# Terminal 2 (different port)
flutter run -d chrome --web-port=8081
```

Or run one on mobile/desktop and one on web.

### 3. Expected Logs on Startup
When each instance starts, you should see:
```
QueryEngine: Creating new query: {"todos":{"orderBy":{"createdAt":"desc"}}}
QueryEngine: Sending query to sync engine for subscription
InstantDB: sendQuery called with: {"todos":{"orderBy":{"createdAt":"desc"}}}
InstantDB: Sending query to establish subscription: {"op":"query","q":{"todos":{"orderBy":{"createdAt":"desc"}}},...}
```

### 4. Test Synchronization
1. Add a todo in Instance 1 (e.g., "Test sync")
2. Within 1-2 seconds, it should appear in Instance 2
3. Toggle completed status in Instance 2
4. The change should reflect in Instance 1
5. Delete a todo in either instance
6. It should disappear from both

### 5. Expected Logs During Sync
**Instance 1 (making changes):**
```
InstantDB: Sending transaction: {"op":"transact","tx-steps":[...],...}
InstantDB: Transaction successful: 776694XXX
```

**Instance 2 (receiving changes):**
```
InstantDB: Received message: transact
InstantDB: Received transact message from another client
InstantDB: Applying remote transaction with X operations
QueryEngine: Received store change - ChangeType.add for entity...
QueryEngine: Re-executing query for key: {"todos":{"orderBy":{"createdAt":"desc"}}}
```

### 6. Troubleshooting
If sync isn't working:
1. Check both instances show "Online" in the UI
2. Look for "Sending query to establish subscription" in logs
3. Ensure both instances are using the same `INSTANTDB_API_ID`
4. Check for any WebSocket connection errors

## Key Improvements
1. Queries now automatically establish subscriptions with InstantDB
2. Connection recovery re-establishes subscriptions
3. Better logging for debugging sync issues
4. Proper handling of remote transactions from other clients

The sync should now work seamlessly - changes in one instance should appear in all other connected instances within 1-2 seconds!
