# Cloud Reactivity Fix - Implementation Details

## The Problem
When running two instances of the app, changes made in one instance were not appearing in the other. The logs showed:
- Local transactions were successful (transact/transact-ok pairs)
- But NO incoming `transact` messages from other clients
- This indicated we weren't properly subscribed to receive updates

## Root Cause
The query subscription wasn't being established because:
1. Queries were executed locally but never sent to InstantDB server
2. Without sending queries, InstantDB doesn't know to send us updates

## The Fix
I made three key changes:

### 1. Added `sendQuery()` method to SyncEngine
```dart
void sendQuery(Map<String, dynamic> query) {
  // Sends 'query' message to InstantDB
  // This establishes a subscription for that query pattern
}
```

### 2. Modified QueryEngine to call sendQuery
When a query is executed:
- Runs locally against triple store
- Sends query to InstantDB via `sendQuery()`
- Tracks subscribed queries to avoid duplicates

### 3. Added connection status listener
When WebSocket connects:
- All existing queries are re-sent to establish subscriptions
- This handles race conditions where queries run before connection

## Testing the Fix
1. Run two instances of the app
2. Make changes in one instance
3. You should now see in the logs:
   - First instance: "Sending query to establish subscription"
   - When changes are made: "transact-ok" confirmations
   - Second instance: "Received transact message from another client"
   - UI updates automatically

## Key Logs to Look For
```
QueryEngine: Creating new query: {"todos":{"orderBy":{"createdAt":"desc"}}}
QueryEngine: Sending query to sync engine for subscription
InstantDB: sendQuery called with: {"todos":{"orderBy":{"createdAt":"desc"}}}
InstantDB: Sending query to establish subscription: {"op":"query","q":{"todos":{"orderBy":{"createdAt":"desc"}}},"client-event-id":"..."}
```

And when other clients make changes:
```
InstantDB: Received transact message from another client
InstantDB: Applying remote transaction with X operations
```

## Architecture Note
This aligns with InstantDB's subscription model where queries themselves act as subscriptions. There's no separate "subscribe" operation - sending a query automatically subscribes you to updates matching that query pattern.
